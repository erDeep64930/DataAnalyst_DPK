		Building Points for Developing Exception Handling Based Applications
	=======================================================================
1. When the Application user enters Invalid Input then we get Runtime Errors
		(Invalid Input------>Runtime Errors)
2. By Default Runtime Errors gives Technical Error Messages, which are Understandable by Programmer But not by End-Users and This is not a recommended Process in Software Industry. Industry Recommends always, Converts Technical Error Messages into User-Friendly Error Messages by using Exception Handling.
		(Invalid Input------>Runtime Errors----->Technical Error Messages)

3.Definition of Exception: Every Runtime Error is called Exception
					(Invalid Input------>Runtime Errors---->Exception)
4. Hence Every Invalid Input gives Exception and that exception generates Technical Error Messages
---------------------------------------------------
5. Definition of Exception Handling: The Process of Coverting Technical Error Messages into User-Friendly Error
								Mesagges is Called Exception Handling
---------------------------------------------------  
6. When an exception occurs in Python Program
			a) Program Execution Abnormally Terminated by PVM
			b) PVM Comes out-of program flow 
			c) By default PVM generates Technical Error Message.

7. To perform Step-(a),Step-(b) and Step-(c) by the PVM, PVM creates an object of Appropriate Exception Class.
8. When an exception occurs in Python Program then PVM always cerates an object of Appropriate Exception Class.
		(Invalid input----->Exception occureces---->Object Creation)
9. Hence Every Exception is considered as object of Appropriate Exception Class 
		( IndexError,ValueError,ZeroDivisionError...etc)
