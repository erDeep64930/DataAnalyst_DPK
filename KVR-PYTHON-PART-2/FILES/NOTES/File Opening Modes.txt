						File Opening Modes
			===========================================================
=>File Opening Modes makes us understand In which mode we are Opening the Files.
=>In Python Programming, we have 8 File Opening Modes. They are
				1. r
				2. w
				3. a
				4. r+
				5. w+
				6. a+
				7. x
				8.x+
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
1. r
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
=>This Mode is used for Opening the File in Read Mode and Performs Read Operations Only.
=>If we open the file in "r" Mode and if that File Does Not Exist then we get FileNotFoundError.
=>If we don't specify any File Opening Mode then PVM Takes "r"  mode as default file mode.
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
2. w
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
=>This Mode is used for Creating the File and Opening the File in Write Mode and Performs Write Operations only. 
=>If we Open NEW FILE in "w" Mode then New File Created and Opened Write Mode and Performs Write Operations
=>If we Open EXISTING FILE in "w" Mode then Existing Data of File OVERLAPPED With New Data
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
3. a
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
=>This Mode is used for Creating the File and Opening the File in Write Mode and Performs Write Operations only. 
=>If we Open NEW FILE in "a" Mode then New File Created and Opened Write Mode and Performs Write Operations
=>If we Open EXISTING FILE in "a" Mode then Existing Data of the File APPENDED With New Data.
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
4. r+
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
=>This Mode is used for Opening the File in Read Mode and Performs Read Operations First and Later we can also 
    Perform Write Operation.
=>If we open the file in "r+" Mode and if that File Does Not Exist then we get FileNotFoundError.
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
5. w+
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
=>This Mode is used for Creating the File and Opening the File in Write Mode and Performs Write Operations First and 
    later we can also Perform Read Operation. 
=>If we Open NEW FILE in "w+" Mode then New File Created and Opened Write Mode and Performs Write Operations 
   and later we can also perform Read Operation.
=>If we Open EXISTING FILE in "w+" Mode then Existing Data of File OVERLAPPED With New Data
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
6. a+
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
=>This Mode is used for Creating the File and Opening the File in Write Mode and Performs Write Operations  and 
    Later we can also Perform Read Operation. 
=>If we Open NEW FILE in "a+" Mode then New File Created and Opened Write Mode and Performs Write Operations    
    and  Later we can also Perform Read Operation. 
=>If we Open EXISTING FILE in "a+" Mode then Existing Data of the File APPENDED With New Data.
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
7. x
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
=>This Mode is used for Creating the File and Opening the File in Write Mode  EXCLUSIVELY and Performs Write 
    Operations only. 
=>If we open EXISTING FILE in "x" mode then we get FileExistError
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
8. x+
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
=>This Mode is used for Creating the File and Opening the File in Write Mode  EXCLUSIVELY and Performs Write 
    Operations  and later we can also Perform Read Operation. 
=>If we open EXISTING FILE in "x+" mode then we get FileExistError
